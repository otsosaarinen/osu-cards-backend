# osu-cards-backend

Works together with the [osu-cards-frontend](https://github.com/otsosaarinen/osu-cards-frontend).

This backend handles database management and retrieves player data from an SQLite3 database when a request is made by the frontend. The database currently contains the data for the top 50 osu!standard players as of February 22, 2025.
